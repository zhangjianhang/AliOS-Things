# Virtual Board based on ARC nSIM

The DesignWare® ARC® nSIM Instruction Set Simulator provides an instruction
accurate processor model for the DesignWare ARC processor families. Such
processor models take the software development out of your products’ critical
path by enabling an early start as well as increased efficiency through
enhanced visibility and control. A basic test environment for nSIM is
implemented in embARC, where hostlink IO is used for message input and output.
ARC related functions can be tested using nSIM such as internal timer, cache
module, interrupt and exception module.
