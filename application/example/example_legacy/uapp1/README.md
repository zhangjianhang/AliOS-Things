## Introduction

This example will generate a standalone application which runs at user space. User can update/load/unload this application at runtime while kernel and other applications still keep running.


```c
         app              app        app
    +------------+  +------------+  +---+
    |   uapp1    |  |    uapp2   |  |   | user space
    +-  -  -  -  +  +-  -  -  -  +  |...|
    |  syscall   |  |   syscall  |  |   |
    +------------+  +------------+  +---+
=====================================================
    +-----------------------------------+
    |             syscall               |
    |-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - | kernel space
    | rhino | hal | lwip | fs |   ...   |
    +-----------------------------------+
                    kernel
```

To run uapp1, you should at least have compiled and flashed kernel which runs at kernel space. If you want to run more user space applications, for example uapp2, you should compile and flash kernel image, uapp1 image, and uapp2 image.

**Also you can refer to kernel/mk/doc/AliOS-Things_user_space_program-v0.4.pdf for more complete experience.**

## Supported Boards

- **developerkit-mk**
- **stm32f429zi-mk**

## Build and flash

Assume you have intalled **aos-cube** tool on your machine. Refer to [Quick Start](https://github.com/alibaba/AliOS-Things/wiki/Quick-Start) for installing aos-cube if you haven't install it.

### Build kernel image

For example, Build kernel image for the developerkit-mk board.

```sh
aos make uapp1@developerkit-mk -c config
aos make MBINS=kernel
```

Kernel image will be generated in `out/uapp1@developerkit-mkkernel/binary` directory.

### Build application images

#### uapp1

```sh
aos make uapp1@developerkit-mk -c config
aos make MBINS=app MBINS_APP=app1
```

uapp1 will be generated in `out/uapp1@developerkit-mkapp/binary` directory.

## Downlaod images

You should install **st-link** tool to download kernel and app images to the board. More info about st-link, refer to [**st-link**](https://github.com/texane/stlink) on github.

### Download uapp1 image

flash uapp1 binary with command:

```sh
st-flash write out/uapp1@developerkit-mkapp/binary/uapp1@developerkit-mk.app.bin 0x08080000
```

### Download kernel image

flash kernel binary with the command:

```sh
st-flash write out/uapp1@developerkit-mkkernel/binary/uapp1@developerkit-mk.kernel.bin 0x08000000
```

On developerkit-mk board, I recommand you flash kernel and app images twice as per my experience, and then reset the chip.

## Useful CLI commands

kernel have registered some CLI commands related to user space application operations, the most useful commands are:

* list all the valid user space applications downloaded on the board

  with command `lsapp`, you can check all the valid user space applications have been flashed on the board.

  ```sh
  # lsapp
  ========== app info ==========
  name                    state
  uapp1                   run
  ```

* check user space application PID

  command `process` will dump all the running applications name, PID and the total task count of the process

  ```sh
  # ps
  ============ process info ============
  Name                pid       tasks
  uapp1               1         4
  ```

* kill an user space application

  To kill a running user space application, issue command `kill PID`, you can check the application's PID number via `process` command

  ```sh
  # kill 1
  process uapp1  is unloaded, pid 1
  ```

* Load an user space application

  Load an application with command `start app_name`, **app_name** is defined with macro `RHINO_CONFIG_APP_NAME` in entry_elf.c. For example, load uapp2 with command：

  ```sh
  # start uapp1
  uapp1 start to run...
  ```

* list user space commands

  Type `help` command in CLI, it wil list all the commands, including user space commands if there are any. For example, the third part commands below are user space commands.

  ```sh
  # help
  
    ====Build-in Commands====
    ====Support 4 cmds once, seperate by ; ====
    help      : print this
    sysver    : system version
    reboot    : reboot system
    time      : system time
    ota       : system ota
    cpuusage  : show cpu usage
    p         : print memory
    m         : modify memory
    echo      : echo for command
    exit      : close CLI
    devname   : print device name
    ps        : process info
    kill      : kill process
  
    ====User Commands====
    tasklist  : list all thread info
    dumpsys   : dump system info
    loglevel  : set sync log level
    ifconfig  : start net interface
    kernel_read_g_proc_var: kernel read g_proc_var
    kernel_set_g_proc_var: kernel set g_proc_var
    lsapp     : list all app
    start     : start app
  
    ====User app Commands====
    uapp1_set_g_proc_var: uapp1 set g_proc_var
    uapp1_read_g_proc_var: uapp1 read g_proc_var
    certificate: run user space certificate test
    uapp1_exit: uapp1 process exit
    uapp1_heap: dump uapp1 heap statistics
  ```
